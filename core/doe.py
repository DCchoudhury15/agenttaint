"""Formal Data Over-Exposure (DOE) model: the mathematical anchor for AgentWard.

Implements the definition from AgentRaft (arXiv:2603.07557, Lin et al., 2026)::

    D_OE = (D_trans \\ (D_nec ∪ D_int)) ∩ D_total

where

    D_total : all data retrieved at the source
    D_trans : the data payload actually delivered to the sink
    D_int   : data the user intended to transmit
    D_nec   : data strictly necessary for the sink to perform its function
    D_OE    : over-exposed data, fields that reached a sink although neither
              intended by the user nor required by the sink

AgentRaft computes these sets offline from a custom agent-trace format and
judges ``D_nec`` with a multi-LLM voting committee. AgentWard computes the
*same* sets at runtime from OpenTelemetry spans and judges ``D_nec`` with a
deterministic Rego policy (see ``collector/policy/``). The formal model is
identical; this module is the shared anchor and is unit-tested against the
paper's worked examples.

This module is pure: no I/O, no OTel, no SigNoz. It operates on sets of
:class:`Field` identifiers so the same logical field is equal across the source
payload, the transmitted payload, and the policy tables.
