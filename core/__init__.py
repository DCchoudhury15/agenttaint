"""AgentTaint core: the formal, substrate-independent model.

The core package holds the mathematical anchor shared with AgentRaft
(arXiv:2603.07557): the Data Over-Exposure (DOE) definition. It depends on no
runtime, no observability stack, and no I/O so the formal model can be tested
and cited in isolation.
