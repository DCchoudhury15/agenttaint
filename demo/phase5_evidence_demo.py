"""Phase 5 evidence demo: collector violations -> tamper-evident Merkle log.

Run after a breach (e.g. via the sidecar) so ClickHouse has recent violations:
    python3 demo/hr_bot/breach_simulator.py --endpoint http://localhost:4319/v1/traces
    python3 demo/phase5_evidence_demo.py

The demo:
  1. records recent collector policy violations from SigNoz into the Merkle log,
  2. prints the current root + count,
  3. proves leaf 0 is in the log (inclusion proof + verify),
  4. demonstrates tamper detection: a modified record produces a different
     root, and the original proof no longer verifies against it.

This is the "cryptographically verifiable Article 30/15 evidence" step: the
lineage/blast-radius dashboards (metrics) become provable records.
