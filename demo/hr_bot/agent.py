"""A small rule-based HR agent that drives the five tools.

Phase 2 is about the SDK plumbing (taint propagation), not agent intelligence,
so the planner is deterministic: it routes a user query to a fixed tool sequence.
A real LangGraph/CrewAI loop would slot in here with no change to the SDK.

The agent emits one trace per run (``begin_run``/``end_run``) and uses **span
links** to record that every tool call was fanned out from a single decision
span, the fan-out/fan-in pattern the lineage map needs (see
docs/agentraft-mapping.md section D, span links).
