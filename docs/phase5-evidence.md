# Phase 5: record, lineage, blast-radius, SLO, and tamper-evident evidence

**Status:** done (local, 2026-09-04). Verified with real collector violations
from SigNoz plus 8 unit tests.

AgentRaft produces *metrics* (57%, F1). Phase 5 turns the violation trail into
**cryptographically verifiable GDPR Art. 30/15 evidence**: a tamper-evident
Merkle log of every violation the collector's Rego policy flags, plus
lineage/blast-radius/SLO dashboards whose queries are the runtime data-flow
record.

## Pieces

- `evidence/merkle.py`: an append-only Merkle (SHA-256) log over violation
  records.
  - `leaf_hash = SHA256(0x00 || canonical_json(record))`
  - `parent_hash = SHA256(0x01 || left || right)`, **ordered** (not sorted) so
    the append sequence is preserved; reordering a prefix yields a different
    root (Crosby-Wallach / CT style).
  - `append` / `root` / `inclusion_proof(i)` / `record(i)`; append-only file
    persistence (rebuilt on load).
  - `verify_inclusion(leaf_hash, proof, root)`: O(log n).
  - `verify_log_consistency(old, new)`: the old prefix's root must equal the
    new log's first `len(old)` leaves' root.
  - `violation_record(...)`: a non-sensitive leaf shape (ids, taint classes,
    policy reasons, never raw values).
- `evidence/recorder.py`: `record_violations(log, service, since_minutes)`
  queries SigNoz/ClickHouse for spans with `agenttaint.policy.violation=1`
  (JSONEachRow via `docker exec clickhouse-client`) and appends each as a leaf.
- `evidence/log.py`: a CLI with `record` / `root` / `prove <i>` / `verify
  <json>` / `count`.
- `dashboards/lineage.json`, `blast_radius.json`, `slo.json`: ClickHouse SQL
  artifacts covering the lineage path per run (Art. 30 recipients/transfers),
  blast radius (distinct tools/destinations per tainted trace, for Art. 30
  disclosure and Art. 15 access), and a clean-run SLO (99% leak-free runs,
  where a violation burns the error budget) plus alerts.

## Verified end-to-end with real data

```
recorded 3 violation(s); log has 3 leaf/leaves           # ask_llm, call_external_api, write_log
Merkle root: f80576da8ff7a61f93e7fbfc316f025caae68a8b5b021c2f9b7245c4d75a1e43
inclusion proof for leaf 0 (ask_llm): verified=true
tamper detection: modified record -> root differs; original proof fails (False)
```

The `ask_llm` violation (real trace_id `203389...`, span_id, timestamp) is in
the log with a verifiable inclusion proof. Editing any record changes the
root and invalidates prior proofs.

## Out of scope (deferred)

- `analysis/fcg.py` + `prompt_synth.py` (AgentRaft's offline FCG / prompt
  synthesis as an audit/fuzz mode). The portfolio goal favors the runtime
  enforcement plus evidence story over the offline audit mode. The synthesized
  prompts would double as the integration-test corpus; left as a future
  addition on top of the Merkle evidence layer.
- Auto-importing the dashboards via the SigNoz MCP (`signoz_create_dashboard`).
  The MCP server isn't enabled in `casting.yaml` yet, so the SQL is the
  artifact for now, and it imports via the UI or MCP once that's enabled.

## Tests

- `tests/test_merkle.py`: 8 green (empty root, append, inclusion, tamper
  detection, stale-proof-after-append, consistency, persistence roundtrip,
  proof JSON roundtrip).
- Full suite: 39 Python green (14 DOE + 8 SDK + 9 redact + 8 merkle).
