# AgentRaft → AgentTaint: Section-by-Section Mapping

This document is the **citation defense** for AgentTaint: it maps each module of
AgentRaft (arXiv:2603.07557, Lin et al., March 2026) to its AgentTaint
counterpart and states the transformation. Anyone reading this should be able to
answer *"what did you actually change vs the paper?"* per section.

## The paper, in one paragraph

AgentRaft defines **Data Over-Exposure (DOE)** as the risk that an LLM agent
transmits sensitive data beyond **user intent** and **functional necessity**
during cross-tool interactions. Formally:

```
D_OE = (D_trans \ (D_nec ∪ D_int)) ∩ D_total

D_total : all data retrieved at the source
D_trans : data payload delivered to the sink
D_int   : data the user intended to transmit
D_nec   : data strictly necessary for the sink
D_OE    : over-exposed data
```

It detects DOE offline via (1) a cross-tool Function Call Graph built by
static type-pruning + LLM semantic validation, (2) BFS prompt synthesis over the
FCG, and (3) runtime taint tracking (LA-DTP) where taint propagation uses an
LLM-judged semantic-dependency function **Φ(a,f)** and D_nec is decided by a
multi-LLM voting committee (GPT-4.1, Qwen3-Plus, DeepSeek-V3.2) grounded in
GDPR/CCPA/PIPL. Evaluated on AgentDojo with 6,675 MCP.so tools; DOE in 57.07%
of call chains; judge F1 97.86%.

## Section map

### A. DOE formal model
- **Paper:** the `D_OE` set expression above; the mathematical definition of the
  risk.
- **AgentTaint:** `core/doe.py` implements exactly this expression as typed set
  operations over `Field` identifiers.
- **Transformation:** **keep verbatim.** This is the formal anchor that makes the
  "same model, different substrate" claim defensible. Unit-tested against the
  paper's worked examples.

### B. Cross-Tool Function Call Graph (FCG)
- **Paper:** directed graph of tool-to-tool edges; hybrid static type-pruning
  (type equivalence/subset/conversion) + LLM validation of semantic relevance;
  call-edge template uses extracted Verb+Object. F1 95.10%.
- **AgentTaint:** `analysis/fcg.py` — **deferred to Phase 5.** Runtime traces
  *are* the call graph; the FCG is only needed for offline audit/fuzz.
- **Transformation:** **drop for MVP**, reintroduce as an offline audit mode that
  also generates the integration-test prompt corpus.

### C. User Prompt Synthesis
- **Paper:** BFS over the FCG for acyclic source→sink paths; instantiate
  templates with concrete user assets; partition into D_int and
  over-exposure candidates. 93.74% trigger coverage.
- **AgentTaint:** `analysis/prompt_synth.py` — a **test-harness/fuzzer** for our
  own demo bot, not a general attack generator.
- **Transformation:** **reframe** — synthesized prompts become the integration
  test corpus that proves the enforcement pipeline fires.

### D. Runtime Taint Tracking (LA-DTP)
- **Paper:** maintains a dynamic Taint Table 𝒯 (field→label); labels at source;
  propagates through three observation points: `source_function`,
  `tool_function`, `sink_function`.
- **AgentTaint:** `sdk/taint.py` (Taint Table materialized as OTel span
  attributes) + `sdk/instrumentation.py` (the three observation points become
  span start/end hooks). Taint rides in **OTel baggage** within a process and
  **span links** across fan-out/fan-in.
- **Transformation:** **replace Φ with structural propagation.** This is the
  core novelty — propagation is real-time and LLM-free.

### E. Φ(a,f) — LLM-judged semantic dependency
- **Paper:** "is field *a* semantically derived from/associated with field *f*?"
  — the expensive, offline, per-step LLM call that drives propagation.
- **AgentTaint:** **eliminated** in the runtime path (baggage carries the tag
  structurally). Optionally reintroduced in Phase 6 as a **fall-back** for
  untagged cross-process flows where the LLM regenerated a value.
- **Transformation:** **the headline trade.** Deterministic structural
  propagation instead of per-step LLM judgment.

### F. D_nec — multi-LLM voting committee
- **Paper:** GPT-4.1, Qwen3-Plus, DeepSeek-V3.2 majority vote, prompted with
  GDPR/CCPA/PIPL data-minimization + least-privilege. F1 97.92% vs ~83%
  single-model.
- **AgentTaint:** `collector/policy/*.rego` — a deterministic, editable Rego
  bundle evaluated per span in the collector processor. Per-sink-class rules
  encode "strictly necessary" statically.
- **Transformation:** **the second headline trade.** Auditable, no 3 LLM calls
  per step, admins edit rules without a rebuild. Trade: loses the committee's
  nuance on novel sinks — acceptable for a product you can ship.

### G. Substrate — AgentDojo custom trace
- **Paper:** custom "Agent Trace" log format (function names, args, return
  values per step). Built on AgentDojo. Target agent GPT-5.1.
- **AgentTaint:** **OpenTelemetry `gen_ai.*` semantic conventions** ingested by
  **SigNoz**. `genainormalizer` unifies OpenInference/OpenLLMetry → `gen_ai.*`
  for LangChain/LangGraph/CrewAI.
- **Transformation:** **the platform trade.** Standard, ubiquitous, the format
  agents already speak.

### H. Enforcement — *not in the paper*
- **Paper:** AgentRaft only **detects** DOE; it does not prevent it.
- **AgentTaint:** `sdk/redact.py` (FF1 format-preserving reversible token for
  internal sinks, non-reversible mask for external/LLM) + an SDK-side egress
  gate + collector-side redact so raw PII is never stored.
- **Transformation:** **AgentTaint's addition.** Detect → enforce.

### I. Evidence — *not in the paper*
- **Paper:** produces aggregate metrics (57.07%, F1, etc.).
- **AgentTaint:** lineage map + blast-radius as SigNoz dashboards, plus a
  tamper-evident Merkle/history-tree log (Crosby-Wallach, O(log n) inclusion +
  consistency proofs) → cryptographically verifiable GDPR Art. 30/15 evidence.
- **Transformation:** **AgentTaint's addition.** Metrics → verifiable records.

## The one-sentence pitch

*"AgentRaft proved you can track sensitive data through an agent — but it's just
a paper, on a format nobody uses. AgentTaint puts its formal model on
OpenTelemetry, replaces the LLM committee with deterministic policy, adds
runtime redaction so the leak never happens, and turns the trail into GDPR
evidence — shipped as a real product on SigNoz."*
