"""Tamper-evident Merkle log of AgentWard violations.

Each violation the collector's Rego policy flags is appended as a leaf. The
log is a Merkle (binary hash) tree over SHA-256, persisted as an append-only
file of leaf records plus a rolling root. This turns the lineage/blast-radius
dashboards from "metrics" into **cryptographically verifiable** GDPR Art. 30 /
Art. 15 evidence: anyone can prove a given violation is in the log (inclusion,
via an O(log n) sibling-hash audit path) and that the log has not been
tampered with or reordered (consistency, via ``verify_log_consistency``,
which recomputes both roots from the full record lists it is given - O(n),
not an O(log n) audit-path proof, but exact).

Design (Crosby-Wallach / Certificate-Transparency style):
  leaf_hash(i)  = SHA256(0x00 || canonical_json(record_i))
  parent_hash   = SHA256(0x01 || left || right)      # ORDERED, not sorted -
                                                       # this is what makes
                                                       # reordering detectable
  inclusion proof for leaf i = the sibling hashes on the path to the root
  consistency proof (new root from old root) = the subtree heads that changed

An odd node at any level is carried up to the next level *unchanged* rather
than being paired with a duplicate of itself. Self-pairing an odd node
(``SHA256(0x01 || C || C)``) is the classic Merkle bug (CVE-2012-2459 in
Bitcoin): it makes the root of an n-leaf tree collide with the root of an
(n+1)-leaf tree formed by appending a duplicate of the last leaf, so an
attacker (or a buggy retry) can insert a record into the log without moving
the root at all. Carrying the odd node up unhashed avoids that collision.

The append-only file stores one JSON record per line (the leaf content); the
tree is rebuilt from the file on load. A separate small manifest could persist
the rolling root, but recomputing from the file on load is simpler and the file
itself is the source of truth (an attacker editing it changes the root).
