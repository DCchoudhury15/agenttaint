"""A deliberately-leaky agent for the fix-suggester to analyze.

NOT run, only AST-analyzed by fix-suggester/suggest.py. It contains two
unguarded egress sinks (an external POST and an LLM create) plus one guarded
internal helper, so the suggester can demonstrate finding the leaks and
emitting the exact one-line fix while ignoring the safe call.
